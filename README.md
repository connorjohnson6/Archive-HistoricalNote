# Archive-HistoricalNote
In this repo, you can see the beginnig of Marist Archives special collections webistes featuring the Lowell Thomas Papers.

To currently view this, I am using Visual Studio Code, and since everything is in html I am using an extesnion off of VSCode called "Live Sever". 
Since this page is not Live, Live server is a server with live reload feature for static & dynamic pages. 

HOW TO OPEN WITH LIVE SERVER
  1. Open a HTML file and right-click on the editor and click on Open with Live Server.
